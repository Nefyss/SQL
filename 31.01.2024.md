## Task 03
### Please find pizzerias that have been visited more often by women or by men. For any SQL operators with sets save duplicates (UNION ALL, EXCEPT ALL, INTERSECT ALL constructions). Please sort a result by the pizzeria name. The data sample is provided below.
```
SELECT p.name AS pizzeria_name, COUNT(*) AS total_visits
FROM person_visits pv
JOIN pizzeria p ON pv.pizzeria_id = p.id
JOIN person pe ON pv.person_id = pe.id
WHERE pe.gender = 'female'
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY p.name;
```

## Task 04
### Please find a union of pizzerias that have orders either from women or from men. Other words, you should find a set of pizzerias names have been ordered by females only and make "UNION" operation with set of pizzerias names have been ordered by males only. Please be aware with word “only” for both genders. For any SQL operators with sets don’t save duplicates (UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT). Please sort a result by the pizzeria name. The data sample is provided below.
```
SELECT name FROM pizzeria
WHERE id IN (
SELECT pizzeria_id FROM person_visits
JOIN person ON person.id = person_visits.person_id
WHERE gender = 'female'
)
UNION
SELECT name FROM pizzeria
WHERE id IN (
SELECT pizzeria_id FROM person_visits
JOIN person ON person.id = person_visits.person_id
WHERE gender = 'male'
)
ORDER BY name;
```
