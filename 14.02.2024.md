## Task 00
### Let’s expand our data model to involve a new business feature. Every person wants to see a personal discount and every business wants to be closer for clients. Please think about personal discounts for people from one side and pizzeria restaurants from other. Need to create a new relational table (please set a name person_discounts) with the next rules.
```
CREATE TABLE person_discounts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    person_id INT,
    pizzeria_id INT,
    discount FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_person_discounts_person_id FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (pizzeria_id) REFERENCES pizzeria(id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_person_discounts_pizzeria_id FOREIGN KEY (pizzeria_id) REFERENCES pizzeria(id)
);
```

## Task 01
### Actually, we created a structure to store our discounts and we are ready to go further and fill our person_discounts table with new records. So, there is a table person_order that stores the history of a person's orders. Please write a DML statement (INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...) that makes inserts new records into person_discounts table based on the next rules.
```
WITH amount_of_orders AS (
	SELECT po.person_id, m.pizzeria_id , COUNT (*) FROM person_order po
	JOIN  menu m ON m.id = po.menu_id
	GROUP BY 1, 2 
	ORDER BY 1, 2
)
INSERT INTO person_discounts
	SELECT
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY 1) AS id,
	person_id,
	pizzeria_id,
	CASE
		WHEN count = 1 THEN 10.5
		WHEN count = 2 THEN 22
		ELSE 30
	END
	FROM amount_of_orders
```

## Task 02 
### Please write a SQL statement that returns orders with actual price and price with applied discount for each person in the corresponding pizzeria restaurant and sort by person name, and pizza name. Please take a look at the sample of data below.
```
SELECT 
    p.name,
    menu.pizza_name,
    menu.price,
    (menu.price - (menu.price * pd.discount / 100)) AS discounted_price,
    piz.name AS pizzeria_name
FROM person_order po
JOIN person p ON po.person_id = p.id
JOIN menu ON po.menu_id = menu.id
JOIN pizzeria piz ON menu.pizzeria_id = piz.id
LEFT JOIN person_discounts pd ON p.id = pd.person_id AND piz.id = pd.pizzeria_id
ORDER BY p.name, menu.pizza_name;
```

## Task 04
### Please add the following constraint rules for existing columns of the person_discounts table.
```
ALTER TABLE person_discounts
ADD CONSTRAINT ch_nn_person_id CHECK (person_id IS NOT NULL) ;

ALTER TABLE person_discounts
ADD CONSTRAINT ch_nn_pizzeria_id CHECK (pizzeria_id IS NOT NULL) ;

ALTER TABLE person_discounts
ADD CONSTRAINT ch_nn_discount CHECK (discount IS NOT NULL) ;

ALTER TABLE person_discounts
ALTER COLUMN discount SET DEFAULT 0 ;

ALTER TABLE person_discounts
ADD CONSTRAINT ch_range_discount CHECK (discount >= 0 AND discount <= 100) ;
```
## Task 05
### To satisfy Data Governance Policies need to add comments for the table and table's columns. Let’s apply this policy for the person_discounts table. Please add English or Russian comments (it's up to you) that explain what is a business goal of a table and all included attributes.
``
COMMENT ON TABLE person_discounts IS 'This table stores information about the discounts offered to specific persons by pizzerias.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN person_discounts.id IS 'The unique identifier for the person discount record.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN person_discounts.person_id IS 'The identifier of the person who is eligible for the discount.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN person_discounts.pizzeria_id IS 'The identifier of the pizzeria offering the discount.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN person_discounts.discount IS 'The percentage of discount offered to the person by the pizzeria.';
```

## Task 06
### Let’s create a Database Sequence with the name seq_person_discounts (starting from 1 value) and set a default value for id attribute of person_discounts table to take a value from seq_person_discounts each time automatically. Please be aware that your next sequence number is 1, in this case please set an actual value for database sequence based on formula “amount of rows in person_discounts table” + 1. Otherwise you will get errors about Primary Key violation constraint.
```
CREATE SEQUENCE seq_person_discounts START 1;
```

```
DO $$ 
BEGIN 
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'seq_person_discounts') THEN
        EXECUTE 'CREATE SEQUENCE seq_person_discounts START ' || (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(id) + 1, 1) FROM person_discounts) || ' OWNED BY person_discounts.id';
    END IF;
END $$;

Проверка существования последовательности:
```
SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'seq_person_discounts') AS sequence_exists;
