### Task 01
## Please write a SQL statement which returns the missing days from 1st to 10th of January 2022 (including all days) for visits of persons with identifiers 1 or 2 (it means days missed by both). Please order by visiting days in ascending mode. The sample of data with column name is presented below.
```
SELECT days::date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS days
LEFT JOIN
		(SELECT missing_days::date AS missing_day, pv.visit_date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS missing_days
		JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.visit_date = missing_days.missing_days
		WHERE pv.person_id = 1 OR pv.person_id = 2) AS tab
	ON days.days = tab.visit_date
WHERE tab.visit_date IS NULL
```

### Task 02
## Please write a SQL statement that returns a whole list of person names visited (or not visited) pizzerias during the period from 1st to 3rd of January 2022 from one side and the whole list of pizzeria names which have been visited (or not visited) from the other side. The data sample with needed column names is presented below. Please pay attention to the substitution value ‘-’ for NULL values in person_name and pizzeria_name columns. Please also add ordering for all 3 columns.
```
SELECT
	COALESCE(p.name, '-'),
	pv.visit_date,
	pi name
FROM person p
	LEFT JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.person_id = p.id AND pv.visit_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-01-03'
	RIGHT JOIN pizzeria pi ON pi.id = pv.pizzeria_id
	ORDER BY 1, 2, 3

### Task 03
## Let’s return back to Exercise #01, please rewrite your SQL by using the CTE (Common Table Expression) pattern. Please move into the CTE part of your "day generator". The result should be similar like in Exercise #01
```
WITH days AS(
	SELECT days::date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS days
LEFT JOIN
		(SELECT missing_days::date AS missing_day, pv.visit_date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-10', interval '1 day') AS missing_days
		JOIN person_visits pv ON pv.visit_date = missing_days.missing_days
		WHERE pv.person_id = 1 OR pv.person_id = 2) AS tab
	ON days.days = tab.visit_date
WHERE tab.visit_date IS NULL)
SELECT * FROM days;
```
