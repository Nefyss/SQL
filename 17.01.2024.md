SQL
## Task 01
### Please modify a SQL statement from “exercise 00” by removing the object_id column. Then change ordering by object_name for part of data from the `person` table and then from `menu` table (like presented on a sample below). Please save duplicates!
```
SELECT object_name FROM (
	SELECT name AS object_name, 'person' as type FROM person
	UNION ALL
	SELECT pizza_name, 'pizza' FROM menu
	ORDER BY type, object_name
	) as tab
```

## Task 02
### Please write a SQL statement which returns unique pizza names from the `menu` table and orders by pizza_name column in descending mode. Please pay attention to the Denied section.
```
SELECT pizza_name FROM menu
INTERSECT
SELECT pizza_name FROM menu
ORDER BY pizza_name DESC
```

## Task 03
### Please write a SQL statement which returns common rows for attributes order_date, person_id from `person_order` table from one side and visit_date, person_id from `person_visits` table from the other side (please see a sample below). In other words, let’s find identifiers of persons, who visited and ordered some pizza on the same day. Actually, please add ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_id in descending mode.
```
SELECT order_date as action_date, person_id FROM person_order
INTERSECT
SELECT visit_date as action_date, person_id FROM person_visits
ORDER BY action_date, person_id DESC
```

## Task 04
### Please write a SQL statement which returns a difference (minus) of person_id column values with saving duplicates between `person_order` table and `person_visits` table for order_date and visit_date are for 7th of January of 2022
```
SELECT person_id FROM person_order
WHERE order_date = '2022-01-07'
EXCEPT ALL
SELECT person_id FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-07'
```

## Task 05
### Please write a SQL statement which returns all possible combinations between `person` and `pizzeria` tables and please set ordering by person identifier and then by pizzeria identifier columns. Please take a look at the result sample below. Please be aware column's names can be different for you.
```
SELECT * FROM person, pizzeria
ORDER BY person.id, pizzeria.id
```

## Task 06
### Let's return our mind back to exercise #03 and change our SQL statement to return person names instead of person identifiers and change ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_name in descending mode. Please take a look at a data sample below.
```
SELECT visit_date, person.name FROM person
JOIN (SELECT visit_date, person_id FROM person_visits
INTERSECT
SELECT visit_date as action_date, person_id FROM person_visits
ORDER BY visit_date, person_id DESC) as tab ON person_id = person.id
```

## Task 07
### Please write a SQL statement which returns the date of order from the `person_order` table and corresponding person name (name and age are formatted as in the data sample below) which made an order from the `person` table. Add a sort by both columns in ascending mode.
```
SELECT visit_date, person.name || '(age: ' || person.age || ')' as person_information FROM person
JOIN (SELECT visit_date, person_id FROM person_visits
INTERSECT
SELECT order_date, person_id FROM person_order
ORDER BY visit_date, person_id DESC) as tab on person_id = person.id
```

## Task 08
### Please rewrite a SQL statement from exercise #07 by using NATURAL JOIN construction. The result must be the same like for exercise #07.
```
SELECT order_date, p.name ||'(age: ' || p.age || ')' as 
person_information FROM (SELECT order_date, person_id FROM person_order) as p_o
NATURAL JOIN person p

```

## Task 09
### Please write 2 SQL statements which return a list of pizzerias names which have not been visited by persons by using IN for 1st one and EXISTS for the 2nd one.
# In
```
SELECT name FROM pizzeria
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT pizzeria_id FROM person_visits)
```
# EXISTS
```
SELECT name FROM pizzeria p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM person_visits v WHERE v.id = p.id)
```

## Task 10
### Please write a SQL statement which returns a list of the person names which made an order for pizza in the corresponding pizzeria. The sample result (with named columns) is provided below and yes ... please make ordering by 3 columns (`person_name`, `pizza_name`, `pizzeria_name`) in ascending mode.
```
SELECT p.name, m.pizza_name, pi.name FROM person_order o
JOIN person p ON o.person_id = p.id
JOIN menu m ON m.id = o.menu_id
JOIN pizzeria pi ON m.pizzeria_id = pi.id 
ORDER BY p.name, m.pizza_name, pi.name;
```
