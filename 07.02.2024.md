## Task 02
### Please create a Database View (with name v_generated_dates) which should be “store” generated dates from 1st to 31th of January 2022 in DATE type. Don’t forget about order for the generated_date column.
```
CREATE VIEW v_generated_dates AS
SELECT days::date FROM generate_series('2022-01-01', '2022-01-31', interval '1 day') AS days
ORDER BY days
```

## Task 03
### Please write a SQL statement which returns missing days for persons’ visits in January of 2022. Use v_generated_dates view for that task and sort the result by missing_date column. The sample of data is presented below.
```
SELECT gd.days AS missing_date FROM v_generated_dates gd
LEFT JOIN person_visits pv ON gd.days = DATE(pv.visit_date)
WHERE gd.days BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-01-31'
AND pv.visit_date IS NULL
ORDER BY missing_date;
```

## Task 04
### Please write a SQL statement which satisfies a formula (R - S)∪(S - R) . Where R is the person_visits table with filter by 2nd of January 2022, S is also person_visits table but with a different filter by 6th of January 2022. Please make your calculations with sets under the person_id column and this column will be alone in a result. The result please sort by person_id column and your final SQL please present in v_symmetric_union (*) database view.
```
CREATE VIEW v_symmetric_union AS
SELECT person_id
FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-02'
UNION
SELECT person_id
FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-06'
EXCEPT
SELECT person_id
FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-02'
INTERSECT
SELECT person_id
FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-06'
ORDER BY person_id;
```

## Task 05
### Please create a Database View v_price_with_discount that returns a person's orders with person names, pizza names, real price and calculated column discount_price (with applied 10% discount and satisfies formula price - price*0.1). The result please sort by person name and pizza name and make a round for discount_price column to integer type. Please take a look at a sample result below.
```

```

## Task 06
### Please create a Materialized View mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats (with data included) based on SQL statement that finds the name of pizzeria Dmitriy visited on January 8, 2022 and could eat pizzas for less than 800 rubles (this SQL you can find out at Day #02 Exercise #07). To check yourself you can write SQL to Materialized View mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats and compare results with your previous query.
```

```

## Task 07
### Let's refresh data in our Materialized View mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats from exercise #06. Before this action, please generate one more Dmitriy visit that satisfies the SQL clause of Materialized View except pizzeria that we can see in a result from exercise #06. After adding a new visit please refresh a state of data for mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats.
```


```

## Task 08
### After all our exercises were born a few Virtual Tables and one Materialized View. Let’s drop them!
```
